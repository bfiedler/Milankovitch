Benthic foram data:

Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic d18O records,

A definitive temperature reconstruction is not offered within the
data set. 
But from:
http://lorraine-lisiecki.com/thesis_appendix.html#2-Appendix-B-The-d18O-of-Foraminifera
is the statement:
 "A large portion change in d18Oc records is thought to result of the sequestration of isotopically light oxygen (16O) in large continental ice sheets, resulting in ocean water that has a larger proportion of 18O."
 Thus reduction of oxygen 18 (which is upward on the graph) indicates warmer conditions and higher sealevel.
